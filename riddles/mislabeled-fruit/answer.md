Key part: None of them are correctly labeled.

    Initial labels    
    B1 : Oranges  
    B2 : Apples  
    B3 : Apples and Oranges
 
    f = draw from B3
    
    if f is an orange:
      B3 must be labeled O because it cant be correctly labeled A+O
      flip the other two labels since they have to be wrong
    
    if f is an Apple:
      B3 must be labeled A because it cant be correctly labeled A+O
      flip the other two labels since they have to be wrong
