Interview Questions
===================

Questions are categorized by what they are testing over. There are algorithmic puzzles, data structure implementations, etc etc. 

Each question is a folder. There's a README.md file inside that folder which contains the question, as well as an answer.md file which contains one possible solution in pseudocode. There might also be implementations in actual code, which would have appropriate extensions. 

If you have any improvements to any solutions, file a pull request. If your answer is positively simpler or faster, then put it in answer.md and rename the old answer.md to something else.
