Imagine a skyline of buildings. In this imaginary skyline, each building rectangle has width 1 and a given height h, like the following example:

           _   _
       _  | |_| |
      | | |     |_
     _| |_|       |
    |             |
    |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
    
Given a list of these heights from left to right, determine the area of the largest rectangle which can fit inside of this skyline.
